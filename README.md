# twinAFK


## What is this?
_twinject_ (**t**ouhou **w**indows **AFK**or) is an AFK (Away From Keyboard ) application based on *Twinject* project DLL injection. Instead of using computer vision techniques to extract data from the game, a DLL is injected and the relevant game data is directly extracted through trampolined functions.
